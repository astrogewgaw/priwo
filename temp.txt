The API is *low-level*: each function in `priwo` returns and takes in a Python
dictionaries. This is by design, so that you, the user, can design your own
high-level API. In doing so, `priwo` does not make any assumptions about how the
pulsar data is going to be used. This is unlike other libraries, such as
[**`your`**][your]. `your` (to which this library is frequently compared to)
provides a high-level API from the beginning, and provides many modules to help
one process and analyse pulsar data. This makes the number of dependencies it
needs high (as of 05/10/22, that number is 9). On the other hand, `priwo` has
only one dependency: [**`pabo`**][pabo], which in turn has only 3 dependencies.
This makes `priwo` an ideal choice to drop into your projects, without worrying
about [**dependency hell**][dependency_hell]. While it is true that there will
be frequent breaking changes to `priwo`'s API before the `v0.0.1` release, one
can always fix its version to ensure that there are no problems, since each
release is well-tested.
