<h2>What is this?</h2>

[**`priwo`**][priwo] is a library that allows you to read in and write out
pulsar data from the following data formats:

* [**`SIGPROC`**][sigproc] headers,
* [**`PRESTO`**][presto] FFT (`*.fft`) files,
* [**`TEMPO`**][tempo] parameter (`*.par`) files,
* [**`PRESTO`**][presto] infodata (`*.inf`) files,
* [**`PRESTO`**][presto] folded data (`*.pfd`) files,
* [**`PRESTO`**][presto] time series (`*.dat`) files,
* [**`SIGPROC`**][sigproc] filterbank (`*.fil`) files,
* [**`SIGPROC`**][sigproc] time series (`*.tim`) files,
* [**`PRESTO`**][presto] best pulse profile (`*.bestprof`) files,
* [**`TEMPO`**][tempo] polynomial ephemerides (`*.polycos`) files.

`priwo`'s API is deliberately *low-level*: each function in `priwo` deals with a
single file format and takes/returns a Python dictionary. This allows users to
design arbitrary high-level APIs on top of `priwo`'s functionality. This is
unlike most other contemporary libraries, such as [**`your`**][your]. `your` (to
which this library has been frequently compared to) provides a high-level API
for reading in pulsar data, while also providing modules to help process and
analyze it. This is makes the number of dependencies it uses is a bit high (as
of 05/10/22, that is a total of 9 dependencies). On the other hand, `priwo` has
just 2 dependencies, [**`numpy`**][numpy] and [**`pabo`**][pabo][^1]. This makes
it an ideal choice to drop into your projects, without worrying about
[**dependency hell**][dependency_hell].

`priwo` is well-tested (via [**`ward`**][ward]) and actively maintained. No
major changes to the API are expected before `v0.1.0`. Support for many more
formats, such as [`PSRFITS`][psrfits], is on the way. If you would like to
contribute, have a look at [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), and get in
touch! If you find a bug, feel free to open an [issue][issues]. If you would
like to suggest support for any data format(s) I have missed, suggest a feature,
or just chat, feel free to jump into the [discussions][discussions].

<h2>Installing</h2>

Installing `priwo` is as easy as:

```bash
pip install priwo
```

<br/>

[^1]: [**`pabo`**][pabo] is a package I made to make parsing binary data easier,
  and it *also* has just two dependencies : [**`attrs`**][attrs] and
  [**`numpy`**][numpy].
