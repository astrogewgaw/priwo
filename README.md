## I/O for common pulsar data formats

[**priwo**][priwo] (a.k.a. **p**ulsar **r**ead **i**n **w**rite **o**ut) is a package written in pure Python that aims to implement simple functions to read in/write out pulsar data (such as time series, spectra, or frequency-time arrays) from various formats, such as those used in the [**presto**][presto] or [**sigproc**][sigproc] packages. I started writing this package because I often needed ways to work with these data in Python, but I did not have the means to access them (especially when the data were in a raw, binary format). The following formats (for both data and metadata) are available right now:

* [**sigproc**][sigproc] headers
* [**presto**][presto] metadata files (`*.inf`),
* [**presto**][presto] time series data files (`*.dat`),
* [**sigproc**][sigproc] time series data files (`*.tim`),
* [**presto**][presto] frequency/power spectra data files (`*.fft`),
* [**presto**][presto] folded data files (`*.pfd`),
* [**presto**][presto] best profile data files (`*.bestprof`),
* [**presto**][presto] polynomial coefficient data files (`*.polycos`).

The package provides simple functions for each data format, and outputs a dictionary with all the data and metadata. The data is read in as a n-dimensional [**numpy**][numpy] array. I will add some simple documentation pretty soon. More formats (such as [**sigproc**][sigproc]'s filterbank files for frequency-time arrays, [**PSRFITS**][psrfits] files for both *fold* and *search* modes, and so on) are on the way :grin: ! If you have any data formats in mind that you would like to see support for, do not hestitate to drop in to the [**discussions**][discussions] page for this very repository. This package is still very much in development, so the api may be subject to frequent breaking changes (at least until the first release, which is coming soon!).
